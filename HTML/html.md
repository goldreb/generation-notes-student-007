`<!DOCTYPE>` - doctype is needed in the HTML for everything else to work. 
`<html></html>` - this element wraps all the content on the page.
`<head></head>` - acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page.
`<meta charset="utf-8">` - represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta related elements. `charset` attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which inlcudes most characters from the vas majority of human written language. 
`<title></title>` - sets the title of the page, it will appear in the browser tab.
`<body></body>` - contains all the content that display on the page.
